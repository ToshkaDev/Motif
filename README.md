# Motif

## Multiple sequence alignments
Using the universal amino acid binding motif we scanned three protein sequence databases: GTDB representative dataset (https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/), NCBI RefSeq (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/), and Uniprot (https://www.uniprot.org/). The details of this procedure can be found in Material and Methods section of the paper describing the discovery of the motif throughout the Tree of Life.

Extracting regions corresponding to the dCache_1 domains in the identified protein sequences we constructed multiple sequence alignemnts.

### The RefSeq alignment
The RefSeq alignment is in RefSeq folder. There are **35433** dCache_1 domain containing proteins in the RefSeq database that have the universal amino acid binding motif.

Positions corresponding to the motif in this alignment:
Y(**2102**)....R(**2319**).W(**2404**)Y(**2433**){n1}Y(**2755**){n2}D(**3375**)

### The Uniprot alignment
The Uniprot alignment is in Uniprot folder. There are **12522** dCache_1 domain containing proteins in the Uniprot database that have the universal amino acid binding motif.

Positions corresponding to the motif in this alignment:
Y(**309**)....R(**314**).W(**316**)Y(**317**){n1}Y(**351**){n2}D(**423**)

### The GTDB alignment
The GTDB alignment is in GTDB_Representative_Set folder. There are **11453** bacterial and **114** archaeal dCache_1 domain containing proteins in the GTDB database that have the universal amino acid binding motif.

Positions corresponding to the motif in bacterial proteins alignment: 
Y(**1167**)....R(**1286**).W(**1298**)Y(**1299**){n1}Y(**1442**){n2}D(**1659**)

Positions corresponding to the motif in archaeal proteins alignment:
Y(**162**)....R(**167**).W(**169**)Y(**170**){n1}Y(**189**){n2}D(**218**)
